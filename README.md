## ABSTRACT


Depression prevalence is growing at a rapid rate making it a health concern across global nations, implementing early diagnoses strategies to identify those at risk is critical for prevention interventions. Within this study, the power of machine learning (ML), particularly XGBoost algorithm, was integrated with health and socioeconomic data to create a predictive model for depression risk. The model revealed high accuracy (.923) and specificity score (.974), and low-to-moderate sensitivity (.454) across the whole population; and robust performance for classification with AUC scores ranging between .58 to .78 with better discriminative ability for medium to high income groups. Among all the risk factors, sleep behavior, alcohol consumption and gender had the greatest driving force for depression. Environmental factors related to socioeconomic status (education and income ratio) were of varying importance across different income groups. These findings demonstrate the potential to integrate ML with healthcare for early detection and prevention of depression and emphasizes the multifaceted role socioeconomic status plays on health and its confounding influence on depression risk. Looking ahead, predictive ML tools for disease should prioritize sensitivity and expand training datasets to include diverse features that provide a holistic view of the health of an individual.
